# Introduction

GameList is a website which allows the user to keep track of each game they have played, whether it's a PC game, mobile game or console game. By creating an account, anyone can use the extensive database of games, user-friendly interface, and advanced search functionality. 

# Features

On the website, you can see the average rating given by users to each game and additional informations about each game like their release date, the studio which developed it (Riot Games, Epic Games...), the type of the game (Action, MMORPG...), and a short description of the game. You can search for a specific game using the search bar or just browse through every games and sort them by score or alphabetically (by name).   
After creating an account, you can create your own list, add games, rate them (from 0 to 10) and say how long you have ~~wasted~~ spent on it. You can add games as favorites, making them appear at the top of your profile page. 

# User experience
 
The user experience of our website is a key factor in its success. The well-designed user interface makes it easy for users to explore the website and manage their game list. The website is even adapted to mobile users, as the layout of each page will scale with the device, making the navigation in the website very comfortable.

# Future improvements  

The website can obviously still be improved, for instance we could add game trailers and screenshots of the game in the game description page in order to give an idea to the user what the game looks like. Another great improvement would be to translate the webpage in multiple languages (French, Spanish, Chinese...), it would improve user experience and make the website more friendly to people who aren't comfortable in English.
In order to improve the user experience, we could add different color modes (like a dark mode), make different layouts (when searching for a game, the user could filter the details of the game) and let the user choose which one he wants to use (only show the name of the games, hide the picture of the games...).  
We could also add a list of games in developement, and news about them (for instance which year the game will be released or when will the beta be available, is it a closed beta or not...). The next step would be to use a real database for the datas related to games and to implement a backend with an express.js file.
